%% Problem 1 - Smith-Waterman alignment
% Consider two sequences 'GTAATCC' and 'GTATCCG'

% Construct the scoring matrix for this with the parameters:
% match value = 2, mismatch value = -1, and gap penalty = -1. Use your
% solution to get the optimal alignment. If you prefer, it is acceptable to do this with
% pencil and paper, you can then take a snapshot of your solution and
% include it in your repository. 

%% Problem 2 - using the NCBI databases and sequence alignments

% Erk proteins are critical signal transducers of MAP kinase signaling.
% Accessions numbers for ERK1 (also called MAPK3) and ERK2 (also called MAPK1) human mRNA are NM_002746 and
% NM_002745, respectively. 

% Part 1. Perform an alignment of the coding DNA sequences of ERK1 and
% ERK2. What fraction of base pairs in ERK1 can align to ERK2? 

% Part2. Perform an alignment of the aminoacid sequences of ERK1 and ERK2.
% What fraction of amino acids align?

% Part 3.  Use the NCBI tools to get mRNA sequences for the mouse genes ERK1 and
% ERK2 and align both the coding DNA sequences and protein sequences to the
% human versions. How similar are they?
